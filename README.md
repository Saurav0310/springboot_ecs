# Jenkins Pipeline Shared Libraries

This is a collection of shared libraries to be used with
[Jenkins Pipelines](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)

  - **Technology Googlechat Notification**: Written in groovy/Jenkins Pipeline DSL. Requires Jenkins
  - **Status**: This repo is intended to be an ongoing effort to collect useful Pipeline libraries.

## Dependencies

This project is dependent on Jenkins Pipeline and
Jenkins >= 2.46.3, though some earlier versions may work, they have not been
tested.

## Installation

These shared libraries may be accessed one of three ways:
1. Add this repo to 'Global Pipeline Libraries' in the Jenkins UI.
1. Include a `libraries` block in declarative pipeline syntax.
1. Include this library in an `@Library` statement in a Pipeline script.

### Global Pipeline Libraries

See [this article](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#global-shared-libraries)
about adding shared libraries via the Jenkins UI.

### Within Pipeline Script

The declarative way to include libraries is the following.

```
libraries {
    lib('github.com/cfpb/jenkins-shared-libraries')
}
```

Since this repo is hosted on github.com, it's easy to include it in all
script dynamically by adding it to the `@Library` block within a Pipeline script

```
@Library('github.com/cfpb/jenkins-pipeline-shared-libraries') _
```

## Usage

Currently this repo has a `sendEmail` var that can be invoked after
importing it. Once the entire shared library has been imported, `sendEmail`
is available at the top level. E.g.

```
pipeline {
    agent { label "master" }

    libraries {
        lib('github.com/cfpb/jenkins-shared-libraries')
    }

    stages {
        stage("Echostage") {
            steps {
               echo "foo"
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            script {
                sendEmail(currentBuild, ['testemail@domain.tld'])
            }
        }
    }
}"""
```

## TODO
Maybe because we no longer have the `triggers`, 'fixed' emails no
longer have 'Fixed' in the subject line, but instead say 'Building'. It would
be nice if we could figure out why this is, and then get the 'Fixed' label
back in the subject line. Note however that emails about failing builds do
still say 'Failure' and 'Still Failing' in the subject.
